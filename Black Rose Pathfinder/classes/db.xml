					<p>An aegis is always considered to be proficient with his astral suit, even if he does not have the appropriate armor proficiency.</p>
					<p>The amount of time forming this astral suit takes depends on the type of suit being formed.</p>

					<p>These free customizations never count against the aegis's total number of customization points spent on his astral suit.</p>

					<p>The aegis chooses the appearance of his astral suit, although its shape must reflect the selections the aegis has chosen:</p>
					<p>astral skin would cover the aegis like a psychoactive skin, astral juggernaut would appear to cover the aegis like plate armor, etc.</p>

				<benefit type="formattedtext">
					<p>An artificer is not a spellcaster, but instead possesses the ability to imbue items with magical power.</p>
					<p>This weird science allows the artificer to create devices that combine the effects of one or more spells, either arcane or divine.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>An artificer has access to both arcane and divine spell lists, but only up to 4th level.</p>
					<p>Any number of spells can be combined into a single device. Spell statistics (casting times, etc.) remain unchanged,</p>
					<p>although no components are required and the artificer is considered the "caster" for the purposes of CL.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Weird science devices must be invented in advance, however -- they cannot be created on the fly.</p>
					<p>The time to create such devices is 4 hours per spell level used. As such, an artificer usually has a fixed collection of</p>
					<p>regularly-carried devices.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Weird science devices are temporary and unreliable. They are able to be used reliably a number of times per day equal to</p>
					<p>1 plus half the class level of the artificer who built the device (rounding up, naturally).</p>
					<p>The device may be used by anyone -- but if used by someone other than the artificer who built it, it requires a Use Magic Device</p>
					<p>roll at DC 15 to activate (a failed roll indicates that the device fails to activate for that user, and a roll of 1 means that the</p>
					<p>device breaks down for good).</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>If the device is used more times than allowed (by anyone), it requires a Use Magic Device skill check with a DC equal starting at</p>
					<p>20 and rising by 1 every additional time the device is used. A failed roll means that the device breaks down and may not be used</p>
					<p>again (the artificer will have to build another).</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Combining multiple magical effects into a single device means that both effects function simultaneously upon activation</p>
					<p>(effectively casting two or more spells at once) -- but such devices are even more unstable than usual:</p>
					<p>The Use Magic Device check for extra activations starts at DC 25 + the number of effects used,</p>
					<p>and goes up for each additional usage by the number of effects used.</p>

					<p>At second level, an artificer's invention ability expands to include the creation of true magic items,</p>

					<p>to emulate each spell normally required to create the item. This ability does not stack with the Master Craftsman feat.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>The magic item creation guidelines are used, and for the purpose of emulating prerequisites, the artificer's effective CL</p>

					<p>A tactician learns to use psionic power to connect willing minds through an internal network that strengthens their psychic bonds.</p>
					<p>As a standard action, a tactician can join any number of willing targets into his collective (up to his limit, see below).</p>
					<p>The tactician must have line of sight to each target, each target must have a Wisdom score of at least 1, and all targets must be within</p>
					<p>Medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft. per class level). The collective can contain up to his key ability modifier or half his tactician level, whichever is higher.</p>
					<p>The tactician is always considered a member of his own collective, and does not count against this limit.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>The tactician can choose to remove a member as a free action on his turn, and any member can voluntarily leave the collective as a free action on their turn.</p>
					<p>Any member whose Wisdom drops to zero or who moves out of range of the collective is automatically removed.</p>
					<p>If a member enters a null psionics field, the connection to the collective is suppressed until the member leaves the field.</p>
					<p>A member who leaves the collective for any reason immediately loses any and all benefits they may have gained from being a member.</p>
					<p>A tactician is aware of the status of his collective and can, roughly, sense the presence of each member, although beyond telling if such a creature</p>
					<p>is still a member, this has no mechanical benefit until higher levels (see telepathy below).</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>A tactician can manifest certain powers through his collective. If a tactician power specifies one or more willing targets (or is harmless) and has a</p>
					<p>range greater than personal, he can manifest this power on a member of his collective regardless of the range of the actual power. All other non-range</p>
					<p>restrictions still apply. He may manifest any power with the Network Descriptor this way, regardless of their actual ranges or targets.</p>
					<p>If he is capable of manifesting powers or casting spells from a different class (as is the case for a multiclass tactician), any compatible spell or power</p>
					<p>with a range greater than touch can also be used through the collective.</p>

					<p>At 4th level, and every three tactician levels thereafter, a tactician learns a new tactical strategy, granting him special abilities in combat.</p>
					<p>Unless specified otherwise, using a strategy is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Strategies are often orders or suggestions</p>
					<p>that the tactician issues to members of his collective. A tactician may not direct a strategy at himself unless a strategy specifies otherwise.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Strategies may be used a number of times per day equal to 3 + the tactician's Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>The tactician chooses his strategy from the list below.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Collective Defenses:The tactician is able to harness the sensory information available through his collective to bolster the defenses of members of</p>
					<p>his collective. For a number of rounds equal to the tactician's Charisma modifier (minimum 1), the tactician and all members of his collective within</p>
					<p>line of sight of the tactician gain an insight bonus to Armor Class equal to the tactician's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Coordinated Distraction: The tactician can direct a member of his collective to attack a single enemy, granting the directed member a +1 competence bonus</p>
					<p>on the attack roll for a number of rounds equal to the tactician's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). If the directed member performs the attack, regardless</p>
					<p>of where the directed member is in relation to the tactician, the tactician treats the enemy as being flanked and the tactician may make a single melee</p>
					<p>attack against the targeted enemy as an Immediate action. The tactician may only make one such attack per use of this strategy. Alternatively, the</p>
					<p>tactician may make the initial attack against the targeted enemy, gaining the +1 flanked, but but using the strategy in this fashion makes it a</p>
					<p>full-round action instead of a swift action. At 8th level and every four tactician levels thereafter, the competence bonus on the attack roll increases by 1.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Coordinated Maneuvers:The tactician can sense when opponents have become vulnerable to different kinds of attack and direct his allies to capitalize on</p>
					<p>these weaknesses, granting members of his collective a +1 insight bonus on one type of combat maneuver attempt, such as bull rushes or repositions, for</p>
					<p>a number of rounds equaling his Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The tactician chooses the kind of maneuver this benefit applies to when he activates this</p>
					<p>strategy. At 8th level and every four levels thereafter, the insight bonus increases by 1.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Directed Assault:The tactician directs a member of his collective to attack a particular target, granting this ally a +1 competence bonus on the attack</p>
					<p>roll for a number of rounds equal to the tactician's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). If the attack is made, the tactician may immediately make a single</p>
					<p>attack at any target within range as an immediate action. This attack does not count as an attack action, so does not qualify for special abilities that</p>
					<p>can be used with an attack action, such as Vital Strike. At 8th level and every four tactical levels thereafter, the competence bonus increases by 1.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Disruptive Terrain:The tactician charges the terrain around him with psychokinetic energy. Any creature not in the tactician's collective treats the</p>
					<p>terrain as difficult terrain for a number of rounds equal to the tactician's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The area of terrain affected is a burst</p>
					<p>effect centered on the tactician with a range of 5 feet per three tactician levels. The affected area does not change if the tactician moves after using</p>
					<p>this strategy. Selecting this strategy requires the tactician to be at least 10th level.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Distracting Gaze:The tactician can target one enemy within 30 feet and make a ranged touch attack against that enemy. If the attack is successful, that</p>
					<p>enemy is treated as if the tactician was adjacent to him for the purposes of determining if he is flanked for a number of rounds equal to the tactician's</p>
					<p>Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Treat the direction for flanking as the direction of the tactician. Selecting this strategy requires the tactician to be</p>
					<p>at least 7th level.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Focus Attack:The tactician can direct a member of his collective to attack a single enemy. If the directed member performs the attack, all subsequent</p>
					<p>attacks on that target for the next round by anyone in the collective deal an additional 1d6 points of damage. An individual gains this additional</p>
					<p>damage on only one successful attack per round, even if they make multiple successful attacks on the targeted enemy. At 8th level and every four</p>
					<p>tactician levels thereafter, this damage increases by 1d6.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Guard Target:The tactician directs a member of his collective to guard a specific target (which may be the tactician, but not the directed member),</p>
					<p>granting the directed member a +1 competence bonus to attack rolls. In addition, the directed member can spend an attack of opportunity to redirect</p>
					<p>an attack made at the target as if it was made at him, even if the attack itself would not normally have provoked an attack of opportunity. Anytime</p>
					<p>the directed member redirects an attack in this fashion, the tactician gains a cumulative +1 bonus to his next attack against the source of the</p>
					<p>redirected attack. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the tactician's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). If the directed member would not</p>
					<p>normally be able to make an attack of opportunity, for example, if they already made one and do not possess the Combat Reflexes feat, they may not</p>
					<p>redirect attacks. At 8th level and every four tactician levels thereafter, the competence bonus on attack rolls increases by 1.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Hold Position:The tactician can direct a member of his collective to hold their ground, granting the directed member a +1 dodge bonus to AC and a +1</p>
					<p>competence bonus to attack rolls for a number of rounds equal to the tactician's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). For each round the directed member</p>
					<p>does not move from the spot, the tactician may immediately take a free move action on the same round, but must move toward the directed member in as</p>
					<p>direct a manner as possible. The tactician gains a +1 dodge bonus to his AC during this move. At 8th level and every four tactician levels thereafter,</p>
					<p>the dodge bonuses and the competence bonus to attack rolls increase by 1.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Into the Fray:The tactician directs a member of his collective to charge a particular enemy, granting the ally a +1 competence bonus on the damage roll.</p>
					<p>If the charge is performed, the tactician may charge the same enemy as an immediate action, gaining a +1 competence bonus on the damage roll.</p>
					<p>At 8th level and every four tactician levels thereafter, the competence bonus increases by 1</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Reposition: The tactician direct each ally in collective to take a 5-foot step as a free action immediately. The tactician may also immediately take a</p>
					<p>5-foot step. This does not count against the number of 5-foot steps allowed in the tactician's or each ally's turns. If all directed allies takes their</p>
					<p>5-foot step, the tactician may immediately make a full attack against any target within range and gain a +1 competence bonus on the attack and damage rolls.</p>
					<p>Selecting this strategy to be at least a 13th level tactician. At 16th level and every four tactician levels thereafter, the competence bonus increases by 1.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Telempathic Resistance: The tactician shares not only thoughts, but also resilience to members of his collective. For a number of rounds equal to the</p>
					<p>tactician's Charisma modifier (minimum 1), all members of the tactician's collective gain a +1 insight bonus to saving throws At 8th level and every</p>
					<p>four tactician levels thereafter, the insight bonus increases by 1.</p>

					<description type="formattedtext">
						<p>This artifacer version of the more famous rod of lordly might has no spell-like powers; however, when wielded by an artifacer, it increases all AC, attack roll, CMD, CMB, and saving throw bonuses from a artifacer's class traits by +1. The rod shares the mundane powers of a rod of lordly might, but its magical weapon forms are tailored to an Artifacers' preferences.</p>
						<list>
							<li>In its normal form, the rod can be used as a +1 returning light mace.</li>
							<li>When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +3 longspear.</li>
							<li>When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a +4 heavy mace.</li>
							<li>When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +2 light crossbow or +2 heavy crossbow.</li>
