					<p>An aegis is capable of repairing mundane items, restoring 2 hit points of damage to the touched item as a standard action usable at will.</p>

					<p>All of the pieces of an object must be present for this ability to function. This ability has no effect on objects that have been warped</p>

				<benefit type="formattedtext">
					<p>Every aegis learns to draw forth ectoplasm and form an astral suit around their form.</p>
					<p>The aegis can select from three different types when forming his astral suit- skin, armor, or juggernaut.</p>
					<p>An aegis is always considered to be proficient with his astral suit, even if he does not have the appropriate armor proficiency.</p>
					<p>The amount of time forming this astral suit takes depends on the type of suit being formed.</p>
					<p>Different astral suit forms grant different free customizations.</p>
					<p>These free customizations never count against the aegis's total number of customization points spent on his astral suit.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>The aegis chooses the appearance of his astral suit, although its shape must reflect the selections the aegis has chosen:</p>
					<p>astral skin would cover the aegis like a psychoactive skin, astral juggernaut would appear to cover the aegis like plate armor, etc.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>An astral suit can be dismissed as a free action.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>An astral suit does not function in areas where psionics do not work, such as a null psionics field.</p>
					<p>Dismiss ectoplasm can be used against an astral suit; treat the manifester level as the aegis's class level,</p>
					<p>although the aegis can simply form his astral suit again on his next turn.</p>

					<p>An aegis learns how to infuse his astral suit with his psionic power, augmenting the capacity of his suit.</p>
					<p>Beginning at 4th level, the aegis may spend up to one power point per four class levels to customize his Astral Suit,</p>
					<p>gaining one temporary customization point for each power point spent.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>This ability, activated as a standard action, lasts for a number of rounds equal to the aegis' Intelligence modifier.</p>
