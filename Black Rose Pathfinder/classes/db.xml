					<p>An artificer is not a spellcaster, but instead possesses the
						ability to imbue items with magical power.
					</p>
					<p>This weird science allows the artificer to create devices that
						combine the effects of one or more spells, either arcane or
						divine.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>An artificer has access to both arcane and divine spell lists,
						but only up to 4th level.
					</p>
					<p>Any number of spells can be combined into a single device. Spell
						statistics (casting times, etc.) remain unchanged,
					</p>
					<p>although no components are required and the artificer is
						considered the "caster" for the purposes of CL.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Weird science devices must be invented in advance, however --
						they cannot be created on the fly.
					</p>
					<p>The time to create such devices is 4 hours per spell level used.
						As such, an artificer usually has a fixed collection of
					</p>
					<p>regularly-carried devices.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Weird science devices are temporary and unreliable. They are
						able to be used reliably a number of times per day equal to
					</p>
					<p>1 plus half the class level of the artificer who built the
						device (rounding up, naturally).
					</p>
					<p>The device may be used by anyone -- but if used by someone other
						than the artificer who built it, it requires a Use Magic Device
					</p>
					<p>roll at DC 15 to activate (a failed roll indicates that the
						device fails to activate for that user, and a roll of 1 means that
						the
					</p>
					<p>device breaks down for good).</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>If the device is used more times than allowed (by anyone), it
						requires a Use Magic Device skill check with a DC equal starting
						at
					</p>
					<p>20 and rising by 1 every additional time the device is used. A
						failed roll means that the device breaks down and may not be used
					</p>
					<p>again (the artificer will have to build another).</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Combining multiple magical effects into a single device means
						that both effects function simultaneously upon activation
					</p>
					<p>(effectively casting two or more spells at once) -- but such
						devices are even more unstable than usual:
					</p>
					<p>The Use Magic Device check for extra activations starts at DC 25
						+ the number of effects used,
					</p>
					<p>and goes up for each additional usage by the number of effects
						used.

					<p>his collective. For a number of rounds equal to the tactician's
						Charisma modifier (minimum 1), the tactician and all members of

						his collective to attack a single enemy, granting the directed
						member a +1 competence bonus
					</p>
					<p>on the attack roll for a number of rounds equal to the
						tactician's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). If the directed member
						performs the attack, regardless
					</p>
					<p>of where the directed member is in relation to the tactician,
						the tactician treats the enemy as being flanked and the tactician
						may make a single melee
					</p>
					<p>attack against the targeted enemy as an Immediate action. The
						tactician may only make one such attack per use of this strategy.
						Alternatively, the
					</p>
					<p>tactician may make the initial attack against the targeted
						enemy, gaining the +1 flanked, but but using the strategy in this
						fashion makes it a
					</p>
					<p>full-round action instead of a swift action. At 8th level and
						every four tactician levels thereafter, the competence bonus on
						the attack roll increases by 1.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Coordinated Maneuvers:The tactician can sense when opponents
						have become vulnerable to different kinds of attack and direct his
						allies to capitalize on
					</p>
					<p>these weaknesses, granting members of his collective a +1
						insight bonus on one type of combat maneuver attempt, such as bull
						rushes or repositions, for
					</p>
					<p>a number of rounds equaling his Charisma modifier (minimum 1).
						The tactician chooses the kind of maneuver this benefit applies to
						when he activates this
					</p>
					<p>strategy. At 8th level and every four levels thereafter, the
						insight bonus increases by 1.

					<p></p>
					<p>Directed Assault:The tactician directs a member of his
						collective to attack a particular target, granting this ally a +1
						competence bonus on the attack
					</p>
					<p>roll for a number of rounds equal to the tactician's Charisma
						modifier (minimum 1). If the attack is made, the tactician may
						immediately make a single
					</p>
					<p>attack at any target within range as an immediate action. This
						attack does not count as an attack action, so does not qualify for
						special abilities that
					</p>
					<p>can be used with an attack action, such as Vital Strike. At 8th
						level and every four tactical levels thereafter, the competence
						bonus increases by 1.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Disruptive Terrain:The tactician charges the terrain around him
						with psychokinetic energy. Any creature not in the tactician's
						collective treats the
					</p>
					<p>terrain as difficult terrain for a number of rounds equal to the
						tactician's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The area of terrain
						affected is a burst
					</p>
					<p>effect centered on the tactician with a range of 5 feet per
						three tactician levels. The affected area does not change if the
						tactician moves after using
					</p>
					<p>this strategy. Selecting this strategy requires the tactician to
						be at least 10th level.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Distracting Gaze:The tactician can target one enemy within 30
						feet and make a ranged touch attack against that enemy. If the
						attack is successful, that
					</p>
					<p>enemy is treated as if the tactician was adjacent to him for the
						purposes of determining if he is flanked for a number of rounds
						equal to the tactician's
					</p>
					<p>Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Treat the direction for flanking
						as the direction of the tactician. Selecting this strategy
						requires the tactician to be
					</p>
					<p>at least 7th level.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Focus Attack:The tactician can direct a member of his collective
						to attack a single enemy. If the directed member performs the
						attack, all subsequent
					</p>
					<p>attacks on that target for the next round by anyone in the
						collective deal an additional 1d6 points of damage. An individual
						gains this additional
					</p>
					<p>damage on only one successful attack per round, even if they
						make multiple successful attacks on the targeted enemy. At 8th
						level and every four
					</p>
					<p>tactician levels thereafter, this damage increases by 1d6.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Guard Target:The tactician directs a member of his collective to
						guard a specific target (which may be the tactician, but not the
						directed member),
					</p>
					<p>granting the directed member a +1 competence bonus to attack
						rolls. In addition, the directed member can spend an attack of
						opportunity to redirect
					</p>
					<p>an attack made at the target as if it was made at him, even if
						the attack itself would not normally have provoked an attack of
						opportunity. Anytime
					</p>
					<p>the directed member redirects an attack in this fashion, the
						tactician gains a cumulative +1 bonus to his next attack against
						the source of the
					</p>
					<p>redirected attack. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to
						the tactician's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). If the directed
						member would not
					</p>
					<p>normally be able to make an attack of opportunity, for example,
						if they already made one and do not possess the Combat Reflexes
						feat, they may not
					</p>
					<p>redirect attacks. At 8th level and every four tactician levels
						thereafter, the competence bonus on attack rolls increases by 1.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Hold Position:The tactician can direct a member of his
						collective to hold their ground, granting the directed member a +1
						dodge bonus to AC and a +1
					</p>
					<p>competence bonus to attack rolls for a number of rounds equal to
						the tactician's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). For each round the

					<p>If the charge is performed, the tactician may charge the same
						enemy as an immediate action, gaining a +1 competence bonus on the

					<p>A guardian vitalist focuses his skill on keeping his allies from
						suffering wounds. He develops psionic abilities that deflect,

					<p>Guardian Power</p>
					<p>A guardian vitalist adds biofeedback to his list of powers
						known. This does not count against his number of powers known.
					</p>
					<p>Guardian Knacks</p>
					<p>A guardian can select one of the knacks below as his method
						knack.
					</p>
					<p> Toughen: The guardian grants one member of his collective a +1
						natural armor bonus for 1 minute.
					</p>
					<p> Resistant: The guardian grants one member of his collective a
						+1 resistance bonus on saves for 1 minute.
					</p>
					<p>Guardian's Touch</p>
					<p>A guardian vitalist of 2nd level who utilizes transfer wounds
						grants the target a number of temporary hit points equal to his
						class level. These temporary hit points last a number of rounds
						equal to the vitalist's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) and do not
						stack with any other temporary hit points.
					</p>
					<p>Guardian's Pulse</p>
					<p>As a free action, guardian of 6th level may project a pulse to
						all members of his collective by spending one power point,
						granting them DR 2/- for one round. Every three vitalist levels
						thereafter, this DR increases by 1.
					</p>
					<p>Swift Aid</p>
					<p>A guardian of 8th level may, as an immediate action and by
						expending his psionic focus, grant a member of his collective a +1
						insight bonus to AC or saves (guardian's choice) that lasts until
						the beginning of the target's next turn. This insight bonus
						increases by +1 every four vitalist levels thereafter.
					</p>
					<p>Guardian's Expertise</p>
					<p>Upon achieving 11th level, anytime a guardian manifests empathic
						feedback, the power gains two additional augment options.
					</p>
					<p> If you spend 6 additional power points, this power may be
						manifested as an immediate action.
					</p>
					<p> If you spend 4 additional power points, the damage dealt to the
						attacker is subtracted from the damage you take.
					</p>
					<p>In addition, any time a guardian manifests a power on a member
						of his collective (including himself) with a range of You and a
						duration measured in rounds, the guardian may expend his psionic
						focus to treat that power as if affected by the Extend Power feat.
					</p>
					<p>Master Guardian</p>
					<p>A guardian of 20th level can, as a full-round action and by
						expending his psionic focus, give one member of the collective a
						psionic bubble of protection. This protective bubble grants DR
						6/-, PR 27, resistance 20 against any attack that deals acid,
						cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, and a +6 deflection
						bonus to AC. This protective bubble lasts for one minute. The
						guardian can use this ability once every 10 minutes.

					<p>Mender Method</p>
					<p>A mender vitalist is the most common found, as he focuses on
						healing wounds more efficiently, even bringing back life to the
						dead. The mender vitalist learns how to boost the body's natural
						healing ability to unimaginable regenerative levels.
					</p>
					<p>Mender Power</p>
					<p>A mender vitalist adds natural healing to his list of powers
						known. This does not count against his number of powers known.
					</p>
					<p>Mender Knacks</p>
					<p>The mender gains the talent below as his method knack.</p>
					<p> Halt Death: The mender can target one member of his collective
						that is dying (at -1 hp or less). That creature is automatically
						stabilized and
					</p>
					<p> does not lose any further hit points. If the creature later
						takes damage, it continues dying normally.
					</p>
					<p>Mender's Touch</p>
					<p>A mender vitalist of 2nd level who utilizes transfer wounds
						heals the target an additional number of hit points equal to his
						class level. This additional healing is not transferred to the
						mender like the normal amount healed.
					</p>
					<p>Mender's Pulse</p>
					<p>As a free action, a mender of 6th level may project a pulse to
						all members of his collective by spending one power point,
						granting fast healing 1 for one round. Every three vitalist levels
						thereafter, this fast healing increases by 1. This healing is not
						eligible to be redirected using
					</p>
					<p>collective healing.</p>
					<p>Swift Aid</p>
					<p>A mender of 8th level may, as an immediate action and by
						expending his psionic focus, heal a member of his collective as if
						he had used transfer wounds.
					</p>
					<p>Mender's Expertise</p>
					<p>Upon achieving 11th level, a mender is skilled at restoring the
						psyche of the recently deceased and efficiently healing his
						collective members. Any time a mender manifests psionic revivify,
						the maximum number of rounds after the target's death allowed
						increases by his Wisdom modifier(minimum 1) without the need to
						suffer additional negative levels.
					</p>
					<p>In addition, anytime a mender manifests a power with the
						[Healing] descriptor, it heals an additional 50% hit points (round
						down).
					</p>
					<p>Master Mender</p>
					<p>A mender of 20th level is capable of healing even the most
						grievous of injuries. As a full-round action and by expending his
						psionic focus, the mender can heal a member of his collective to
						full health, including restoring any ability drain, removing
						fatigue or exhaustion, and curing any poisons or diseases. The
						mender can use this ability once every 10 minutes.

					<p>Soulthief Method</p>
					<p>A soulthief vitalist develops techniques that focus on
						harnessing the energy of enemies, siphoning it off and using it to
						heal himself and his allies.
					</p>
					<p>Soulthief Power</p>
					<p>A soulthief vitalist adds collapse to his list of powers known.
						This does not count against his number of powers known.
					</p>
					<p>Soulthief Knacks</p>
					<p>The soulthief vitalist can choose a talent that focuses on
						debilitating and manipulating the energy of enemies.
					</p>
					<p> Fatigue: As a ranged touch attack, a soulthief may cause a
						target to be fatigued for a number of rounds equal to his class
						level. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + soulthief's wisdom
						modifier) negates this effect. This ability has no effect on a
						creature that is already fatigued.
					</p>
					<p> Siphon: A soulthief may direct a ray of psionic energy at a
						target as a ranged touch attack. If it hits, the target suffers
						1d3 points of damage, and the soulthief, or one member of his
						collective (soulthief's choice), gains 1 temporary hit point for 1
						minute.
					</p>
					<p>Soulthief's Touch</p>
					<p>A soulthief vitalist of 2nd level who utilizes transfer wounds
						can choose to instead deal the amount of damage that transfer
						wounds would normally heal plus the soulthief's class level to the
						target, healing himself a number of hit points equal to the damage
						dealt. A soulthief may not heal more hit points than the touched
						creature had prior to using this ability.
					</p>
					<p>This ability may only be used on creatures with a Constitution
						score and may not be used against creatures in the soulthief's
						collective. A soulthief may use this ability on creatures with a
						total number of hit dice less than half his vitalist level, but he
						gains no healing from it.
					</p>
					<p>Soulthief's Pulse</p>
					<p>As a free action, a soulthief of 6th level may project a pulse
						to all members of his collective by spending one power point,
						which empowers the attacks of the members of the collective for
						one round. Any successful damaging attack made with an attack roll
						made by a member of the collective heals the attacker for the
						damage dealt, up to 2 hit points of damage. Every three vitalist
						levels thereafter, the maximum healing granted by this aura
						increases by 1.
					</p>
					<p>Swift Aid</p>
					<p>A soulthief of 8th level may, as an immediate action and by
						expending his psionic focus, transfer the wounds of a member of
						his collective to an enemy within 15 ft. of the ally for an amount
						of damage equal to the soulthief's transfer wounds ability. A
						successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 class level + Wisdom
						modifier) negates the effect.
					</p>
					<p>Soulthief's Expertise</p>
					<p>Upon achieving 11th level, anytime a soulthief manifests hostile
						empathic transfer, the attack can be made as a ranged touch attack
						with a range of 30 feet instead of as a melee touch attack. In
						addition, every additional power point spent augmenting hostile
						empathic transfer increases the additional damage transferred by
						7, rather than by 5, and the maximum number of points of damage
						transferred increases to 85.
					</p>
					<p>In addition, any time a soulthief manifests a power or psi-like
						ability that deals hit point damage, it heals him for 50% of the
						damage dealt. If the power does hit point damage to multiple
						targets, the soulthief only heals 50% of the damage to the target
						dealt the highest damage.
					</p>
					<p>Master Soulthief</p>
					<p>A soulthief of 20th level learns how to siphon the life out of a
						creature. Once every 10 minutes, the soulthief can choose one
						target to which he has line of sight and, as a full-round action
						and by expending his psionic focus, begin draining the target of
						health (12d6 points of empathic damage) which is then transferred
						to the collective and heals an equal amount of damage. A
						successful Will save (DC 20 + Wis modifier) negates the effect.
						Each round, the target may attempt another Will save to negate the
						effect. The soulthief can maintain concentration to continue the
						damage each round, for up to one minute. Any damage done after all
						members of the collective are healed completely instead grants
						temporary hit points to any member of the collective (soulthief's
						choice) for 10 minutes. The soulthief may divide these temporary
						hit points as he so chooses among members of the collective.

						hand, he must make a concentration check or lose the spell. The DC
						for this check is equal to 20 + the spell's level. If the object
						is a ring or amulet, it occupies the ring or neck slot
						accordingly.
					</p>
					<p>Once per day, your bonded item allows you to cast any one of our
						spells known (unlike a wizard's bonded item, which allows him to
						cast any one spell in his spellbook). This spell is treated like
						any other spell cast by the sorcerer, including casting time,
						duration, and other effects dependent on the sorcerer's level.
						This spell cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other
						abilities.
					</p>
					<p>A sorcerer can add additional magic abilities to his bonded
						object as if he has the required item creation feats and if he
						meets the level prerequisites of the feat. For example, a sorcerer
						with a bonded dagger must be at least 5th level to add magic
						abilities to the dagger (see the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat
						in Feats). If the bonded object is a wand, it loses its wand
						abilities when its last charge is consumed, but it is not
						destroyed and it retains all of its bonded object properties and
						can be used to craft a new wand. The magic properties of a bonded
						object, including any magic abilities added to the object, only
						function for the sorcerer who owns it. If a bonded object's owner
						dies, or the item is replaced, the object reverts to being an
						ordinary masterwork item of the appropriate type.
					</p>
					<p>If a bonded object is damaged, it is restored to full hit points
						the next time the sorcerer prepares his spells. If the object of
						an arcane bond is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1
						week in a special ritual that costs 200 gp per sorcerer level plus
						the cost of the masterwork item. This ritual takes 8 hours to
						complete. Items replaced in this way do not possess any of the
						additional enchantments of the previous bonded item. A sorcerer
						can designate an existing magic item as his bonded item. This
						functions in the same way as replacing a lost or destroyed item
						except that the new magic item retains its abilities while gaining
						the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded item.

					<p>While a weapon made of deep crystal is no different from a

						crystal. For 2 power points, the deep crystal weapon deals an

					Characters who have levels in a psionic class, creatures with the
					psionic subtype, and creatures with the Wild Talent feat possess
					psionic auras. The amount of information revealed by the
					manifestation of this power depends on how long you study a
					particular area or subject.
				</p>
				<p>1st Round: Presence or absence of psionic auras.</p>
				<p>2nd Round: Number of different psionic auras and the strength of
					the most potent aura.
				</p>
				<p>3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items
					or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make
					Knowledge (Psionics) checks to determine the discipline involved in
					each aura. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + power level, or 15 +
					one-half manifester level for an effect that is not created by a
					power, such as that of a psionic item.) If the aura emanates from a
					psionic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see
					Spellcraft).
				</p>
				<p>Psionically charged locations, multiple disciplines, or strong
					local psionic emanations may confuse or conceal weaker auras.
				</p>
				<p>Aura Strength: A psionic aura's strength depends on a functioning
					power's level or an item's manifester level. If an aura falls into
					more than one category, detect Psionics indicates the stronger of
					the two. Detection of an overwhelming aura (see the accompanying
					table) dazes you for 1 round and the power ends.

				<p>Lingering Aura: A psionic aura lingers after its original source
					dissipates (in the case of a power) or is destroyed (in the case of
					a psionic item). If detect Psionics is manifested and directed at
					such a location, the power indicates an aura of dim (even weaker
					than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level
					depends on its original strength:
				</p>

				<p>Each round, you can turn to detect Psionics in a new area. You
					can tell the difference between magical and psionic auras.
				</p>
				<p>The power can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of
					common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt
					blocks it.
				</p>
				<p>Augment This power may be augmented in the following way.</p>
				<p>Augment: If you spend 2 additional power points, the duration
					changes to 3 rounds/lvl. (D) (no concentration required) and it
					also gives you a +10 enhancement bonus on Spellcraft checks made to
					identify the properties and command words of magic items in your

					and one ally. Whenever the target must make a Will save, you make
					the save instead as if the effect targeted you. If you fail in the
					saving throw, your ally suffers the consequences of the effect that
					forced the Will save and you must make an additional Will save at
					the same DC or be stunned for one round. The target may willingly
					fail saves against harmless powers without causing you to be
					stunned. Once the connection is forged, you can make Will saves for
					your ally as long as she remains in range. If she strays out of
					range, the power ends. You may not willingly fail a save when using
					psychic bodyguard, but you may allow the target to make her own
					save. The power immediately ends after you have made a successful
					Will save for the target.

					Augment: This power may be augmented in
					one or more of the following ways.

					1. For every additional 2 power
					points spent, the power lasts for
					one additional successful Will
					save.

					2. If you spend 8 additional power points, the power is not

				<p>A blob of malleable, adhesive ectoplasm shoots out from your
					outstretched hand, attached by an ectoplasmic cord. Upon hitting
					its target, this ectoplasmic grapnel reels in, pulling the target
					to you - or you to it.

					When manifesting this power, you must have a
					hand free, and must make a
					ranged touch attack against the target; a
					miss causes the grapnel
					to retract instantly without attaching to
					anything. Alternately,
					you may have it shoot out from your shield
					instead of a free hand;
					you still get your shield's AC bonus against
					the target, but lose
					it against anyone else for the duration of the
					power.

					If you target a creature no more than one size category
					larger than
					you, you may attempt a drag combat maneuver check. If
					successful,
					you move the creature 5 feet closer to you. For every 5
					by which
					your attack exceeds your opponent's CMD, you can drag the
					target an
					additional 5 feet toward you. If the creature is willing,
					you may
					drag it up to 30 feet closer to you.

					If you target an
					unattended object, you may pull it up to 30 feet
					towards you; if
					this moves it into your square, you may grasp the
					item immediately
					as a free action, although you must have a free
					hand to do so. If
					you target an attended object, the ranged touch
					attack is made
					against the opponent, and you must succeed at a
					disarm or steal
					(your choice) combat maneuver check to wrest the
					item free.

					If you
					fail at the combat maneuver check (or if you target an
					immovable
					object such as a creature more than one size category
					larger than
					you, an object bolted to the floor, or a building wall,
					floor, or
					ceiling), you are instead moved up to 30 feet towards the
					target.
					This movement provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternately,
					you may
					choose to relinquish your grip on the ectoplasmic cord,
					knocking you
					prone and ending the power immediately rather than
					moving you
					towards the target. If you end your movement at a
					climbable location
					(such as a wall or ledge), you must attempt a
					Climb check (at normal
					DC) to grab hold (or pull yourself over the
					edge, in the case of a
					ledge); failure means you begin falling, and
					must make a second
					Climb check with +20 DC to catch yourself.

					If you spend a full-round
					action bracing yourself before manifesting
					this power, you get a +2
					bonus on the above combat maneuver checks.
					Each adjacent ally that
					spends an Aid Another action to grab hold
					of you also adds a +2
					bonus to your combat maneuver check, but also
					suffers the
					consequence of being dragged or knocked prone with you
					should the
					check fail. If the power duration should be extended
					beyond
					instantaneous (see augment below), each ally holding onto
					you must
					spend an Aid Another action each turn to maintain their
					hold. If you
					end your movement at a climbable location, each ally
					may make a
					Climb check to grab the wall, or may instead continue
					holding onto
					you; your own Climb check is penalized as normal if
					their combined
					weight drops your encumbrance into a category with a
					worse armor
					check penalty.

					If you manifest this power while engaged in a grapple
					that you are in
					control of, you immediately make a grapple combat
					maneuver check;
					failure means you are no longer grappling the
					creature, while
					success means you gain a +2 bonus to your drag
					combat maneuver
					check for each creature (besides yourself)
					participating in the
					grapple. If the drag combat maneuver check
					fails, you and everyone
					in the grapple are dragged (or knocked
					prone) accordingly.

					If you manifest this power while engaged in a
					grapple that you are
					not in control of, you immediately make a
					grapple combat maneuver
					check; success means you have broken free of
					the grapple, while
					failure means you are still grappling (but gain a
					+2 bonus to your
					drag combat maneuver check for each creature
					(besides yourself)
					participating in the grapple). If the drag combat
					maneuver check
					fails, you and everyone in the grapple are dragged
					(or knocked
					prone) accordingly, unless the creature grappling you is
					too large
					for you to drag (in which case the cord snaps and the
					power fails).
					The grappling creature may voluntarily release you
					from the grapple
					to avoid being dragged or knocked prone, but must
					do so before the
					combat maneuver check is rolled.

					Augment: You can
					augment this power in one or more of the following ways:

					1. If you
					spend 2 additional power points, the duration increases
					to 1
					rnd./lvl. if the ranged touch attack hits. The cord does not
					automatically retract; you may choose to retract or extend the cord
					up to 30 feet (to the limit of the power's range) as a standard
					action, and must succeed at a combat maneuver check each time you
					attempt to drag an unwilling creature in this manner. Other
					creatures may climb or manipulate the cord as they would a rope,
					but it is as strong as a chain. An unwilling creature attached to
					the grapnel must cut (5 hp, hardness 10, AC 10) or burst (Str DC
					26) the cord to move away from you, unless he succeeds at a drag
					combat maneuver check to pull you behind him. If the cord is cut or
					burst, or if you let go of the cord (a free action), the power ends
					immediately.

					2. If you spend 2 additional power points, the range of
					the power
					increases to Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./lvl.).

					3. If you
					spend 4 additional power points, the cord retracts the full
					length
					instantly. A successful combat maneuver check, by any
					margin, pulls
					the target adjacent to you, while a failed combat
					maneuver check
					pulls you adjacent to the target (unless you
					relinquish the cord and
					go prone instead).

					4. For every 4 additional power points you spend,
					this power can drag
					creatures an additional size category larger
					than you, and the
					cord's hardness increases by 2, hit points
					increases by 10, and
					break DC increases by 2.

					5. If you spend 4
					additional power points, you can manifest this
					power as a move
					action.

					In addition, for every 2 additional power points you spend
					to achieve
					any of these effects, you also gain a +1 bonus on any
					combat
					maneuver checks or Climb checks you make for this power.

				<p>You transfer your hurt to another. When you manifest this power
					and then make a successful touch attack, you can transfer 50 points
					of damage (or less, if you choose) from yourself to the touched
					creature. The damage you transfer may not exceed the damage you
					currently have. You immediately regain hit points equal to the
					amount of damage you transfer.

					You cannot use this power to gain hit
					points in excess of your full
					normal total. The transferred damage
					is empathic in nature, so
					powers and abilities the subject may have
					such as damage reduction
					and regeneration do not lessen or change
					this damage.

					The damage transferred by this power has no type, so
					even if the

					originally took, the
					transfer occurs normally and deals hit point
					damage to the subject.

					Augment You can augment this power in one or
					both of the following
					ways.

					For every additional power point you
					spend, you can transfer an
					additional 5 points of damage (maximum 70
					points per
					manifestation), although you must still have that amount
					of actual
					damage to transfer.

				<p>When manifesting this power, you must choose one kind of saving
					throw: Fortitude, Reflex, or Will. For the duration of the power,
					all willing targets share the highest base bonus to that save. This
					only includes bonus to saves from hit dice (including Racial hit
					dice and class levels), not any bonuses from ability scores, Racial
					Traits, class features, temporary effects such as powers, spells,
					and items, or such. You and all willing targets may use the highest
					save between you in place of their original values.

					Alternatively,
					you may force all targets to use the lowest save bonus between you
					in place of their original base save. If this decreases the
					target's bonus, then the target may attempt a Will save (with his
					normal Will saving throw modifier) every round to ignore the
					effects of this power for that round.

					Augment: You can augment this
					power in one or more of the following ways.

					1. If you spend 2
					additional power points, you may choose a second
					kind of saving
					throw to share. If you spend 6 additional power
					points, you may
					choose to share all three kinds of saves with all
					targets. Compare

					original, and use the
					favorable choice for the version of the power
					you are using.

					2. For

					one
					class feature belonging to you or a target that directly
					modifies
					the saving throw(s) you share, either by providing a bonus
					or by
					altering the effects of successful and/or failed saves.
					Example
					class features include Evasion and Improved Evasion, Still
					Mind,
					Divine Grace, and Slippery Mind. The GM may allow additional
					abilities at his discretion. You may effectively grant this class
					feature to any or all willing targets of your choice; treat them as
					if they actually had the class feature in question, with one
					exception: if a class feature has additional benefits besides
					directly modifying the saving throw (such as fear immunity from
					Aura of Courage), then they are not included.

					In addition, for every
					2 power points spent to achieve either of
					these effects, the save DC
					increases by 1.

					effect, gaining the benefits from abilities such as bardic
					performance, or using any Charisma-based skill check (except Use
					Magic Device). The target no longer counts as an ally for the
					purposes of determining flanking and all creatures who threaten the
					subject are considered allies for their own flanking purposes. In
					addition, the subject cannot make attacks of opportunity while
					under this effect.

					The subject still understands if his attacks or
					powers are successful.

					Augment: For every additional power point you
					spend, this power may
					affect an additional target. No two targets
					may be further than 15
					feet apart. For every 2 power points spent
					this way, the power's
					save DC increases by 1.

					its most recently gained skill ranks differently (picking new
					skills and abandoning old ones if it chooses) and to choose a
					different feat from the one it selected when advancing from its
					previous level to its current level.

					The subject can also choose to
					forget powers or spells it acquired
					when advancing to its current
					level, replacing them with new ones.

					The subject can undo decisions
					of these sorts that were made at
					lower levels, although he suffers
					increased penalties the farther
					back he goes to undo decisions. The
					subject must abide by the
					standard rules for selecting skills and
					feats, and so it cannot
					take feats for which it doesn't qualify. Any
					change made must have
					been available at the level selected. For
					example, a 7th level
					Psion who uses this power to change a 2nd level
					power gained at 3rd
					level Psion cannot select a 4th level power to
					replace it - he must
					choose a 1st or 2nd level power.

					The subject is
					not limited to changing only a single level's choices
					should he
					decide to undo decisions from prior levels. Every level
					between his
					current level and the earliest level may be altered, so
					long as the
					choices made were valid at the appropriate level.

					If the subject
					goes farther back than the changes from the previous
					level to its
					current level, the subject suffers a cumulative -1
					penalty on all
					ability checks, attack rolls, combat maneuver
					checks, Combat
					Maneuver Defense, saving throws, and skill checks
					for each level
					back the power changes. In addition, the creature
					reduces its
					current and total hit points by 5 for each level back
					the power
					changes. The creature is also treated as one level lower
					for the
					purpose of level-dependent variables (such as spellcasting
					or
					manifesting) for each level back the power changes. These
					penalties
					last for 24 hours.

					Augment This power may be augmented in either of
					the following ways.

					1. If you spend 2 additional power points, the
					penalties end after the
					subject rests for 8 hours.
					2. If you spend 6
					additional power points, the subject does not suffer
					any penalties.

						<b>Class Features</b>
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>The following are class features of the aegis.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						<b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies</b>
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Aegii are proficient with all simple and martial weapons. Aegii
						are proficient with light armor and shields (but not tower
						shields).
					</p>
					<p>Armor does not interfere with the aegis's class features.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						<b>Power Points/Day:</b>
						An aegis's ability to manifest some of his abilities is limited by
						the power points he has available. His base daily allotment
					</p>
					<p>of power points is given on Table: The Aegis. In addition, he
						receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Intelligence
						score
					</p>
					<p>(see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points), treating
						his manifester level for the purposes of bonus power points as
						equal to his
					</p>
					<p>class level. His race may also provide bonus power points per
						day, as may certain feats and items.

						<b>Class Features</b>
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>The following are class features of the cryptic.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						<b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies</b>
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Cryptics are proficient with all simple, plus the rapier and
						shortbow. Cryptics are proficient with light armor but not with
						shields.
					</p>
					<p>Armor does not interfere with the cryptic's class features.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Power Points/Day: A cryptic's ability to manifest powers is
						limited by the power points she has available. Her base daily
						allotment of power
					</p>
					<p>points is given on Table: The Cryptic. In addition, she receives
						bonus power points per day if she has a high Intelligence score
					</p>
					<p>(see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points). Her race
						may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats
						and items.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						<b>Powers Known</b>
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>A cryptic begins play knowing one cryptic power of your choice.
						Each time she achieves a new level, she unlocks the knowledge of a
						new power.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Choose the powers known from the cryptic power list. (Exception:
						The feat Expanded Knowledge does allow a cryptic to learn powers
						from the
					</p>
					<p>lists of other classes.) A cryptic can manifest any power that
						has a power point cost equal to or lower than her manifester
						level.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>The total number of powers a cryptic can manifest in a day is
						limited only by her daily power points.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>A cryptic simply knows her powers; they are ingrained in her
						mind. She does not need to prepare them (in the way that some
						spellcasters
					</p>
					<p>prepare their spells), though she must get a good night's sleep
						each day to regain all her spent power points.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>The Difficulty Class for saving throws against cryptic powers is
						10 + the power's level + the cryptic's Intelligence modifier.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						<b>Maximum Power Level Known</b>
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>A cryptic begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level
						powers. As she attains higher levels, she may gain the ability to
						master more complex powers.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>To learn or manifest a power, a cryptic must have an
						Intelligence score of at least 10 + the power's level.

						<b>Class Features</b>
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>All of the following are class features of the tactician.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						<b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b>
						Tacticians are proficient with all simple and martial weapons,
						with all types of light and medium armor,
					</p>
					<p>and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						<b>Power Points/Day:</b>
						A tactician's ability to manifest powers is limited by the power
						points he has available. His base daily allotment of
					</p>
					<p>power points is given on Table: The Tactician. In addition, he
						receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Intelligence
						score
					</p>
					<p>(see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points) His race
						may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats
						and items.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						<b>Powers Known:</b>
						A tactician begins play knowing one tactician power of your
						choice. Each time he achieves a new level, he unlocks knowledge of
						a new power.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Choose the powers known from the tactician power list.
						(Exception: The feat Expanded Knowledge does allow a tactician to
						learn powers from
					</p>
					<p>the lists of other classes.) A tactician can manifest any power
						that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester
						level.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>The total number of powers a tactician can manifest in a day is
						limited only by his daily power points.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>A tactician simply knows his powers, they are ingrained in his
						mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the way that some
						spellcasters
					</p>
					<p>prepare their spells), though he must get a good night's sleep
						each day to regain all his spent powers.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>The Difficulty Class for saving throws against the tacticians
						powers is 10 + the power's level + the tactician's Intelligence
						modifier.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						<b>Maximum Power Level Known:</b>
						A tactician begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level
						powers. As he attains higher levels, he may gain the
					</p>
					<p>ability to master more complex powers.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>To learn or manifest a power, a tactician must have an
						Intelligence score of at least 10 + the power's level.

						<b>Class Features</b>
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>All of the following are class features of the Vitalist.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Vitalists are proficient with all
						simple weapons and light armor, but not with shields. Armor does
						not, however,
					</p>
					<p>interfere with the manifestation of powers.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						<b>Power Points/Day</b>
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>A vitalist's ability to manifest powers is limited by the power
						points he has available. His base daily allotment of power points
						is given on Table:
					</p>
					<p>The Vitalist. In addition, he receives bonus power points per
						day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers
						and Bonus Power Points).
					</p>
					<p>His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may
						certain feats and items.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						<b>Powers Known</b>
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>A vitalist begins play knowing two vitalist powers of your
						choice. At every odd-numbered class level after 1st, he unlocks
						the ability to know
					</p>
					<p>more powers at any given time.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Choose the powers known from the vitalist power list, or from
						the list of powers of your chosen discipline (if any). You cannot
						choose powers
					</p>
					<p>from disciplines other than your chosen discipline. (Exception:
						The feat Expanded Knowledge does allow a vitalist to learn powers
						from the lists
					</p>
					<p>of other disciplines or even other classes.) A vitalist can
						manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower
						than his manifester level.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>The number of times a vitalist can manifest powers in a day is
						limited only by his daily power points.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>A vitalist never needs to prepare powers ahead of time; he draws
						them from his mind when needed. When a vitalist recovers his daily
						power points
					</p>
					<p>after resting, he may choose to rotate one or more powers he
						knows for new ones. These powers must always be chosen from the
						vitalist power list,
					</p>
					<p>and the maximum number of powers the vitalist may know at any
						one time in this fashion is listed on Table: The Vitalist. If a
						vitalist learns a
					</p>
					<p>power through other means, such as the Expanded Knowledge feat
						or psychic chirurgery, this power is known in addition to his
						normal powers. He
					</p>
					<p>may never exchange it for another power from the vitalist list
						when he chooses his powers known, and it doesn't count against his
						limit of powers
					</p>
					<p>known at any one time.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>The Difficulty Class for saving throws against vitalist powers
						is 10 + the power's level + the vitalist's Wisdom modifier.
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						<b>Maximum Power Level Known:</b>
						A vitalist begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level powers.
						As he attains higher levels, he may gain the ability
					</p>
					<p>to master more complex powers.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>To learn or manifest a power, a vitalist must have an Wisdom
						score of at least 10 + the power's level.

						<b>Bloodline:</b>
						Each sorcerer has a source of magic somewhere in her heritage that
						grants her spells, bonus feats, an additional class skill, and
						other special abilities. This source can represent a blood
						relation or an extreme event involving a creature somewhere in the
						family's past. For example, a sorcerer might have a dragon as a
						distant relative or her grandfather might have signed a terrible
						contract with a devil. Regardless of the source, this influence
						manifests in a number of ways as the sorcerer gains levels. A
						sorcerer must pick one bloodline upon taking her first level of
						sorcerer. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.
					</p>
					<p>At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter, a sorcerer learns
						an additional spell, derived from her bloodline. These spells are
						in addition to the number of spells given on Table: Sorcerer
						Spells Known. These spells cannot be exchanged for different
						spells at higher levels.
					</p>
					<p>At 7th level, and every six levels thereafter, a sorcerer
						receives one bonus feat, chosen from a list specific to each
						bloodline. The sorcerer must meet the prerequisites for these
						bonus feats.
